## Light weight development

Transending further into my rabbit hole

So I'm actually forcing myself to create this content using this laptop. No promises how long this will continue; the screen is 11 inches, my eye sight is bad. Besides that, I really dislike to use a mousepad and a laptop keyboard as well. Using this thing for a prolonged time it is a recipe for headache and sore neck.

At this point, you might be banging your head on the desk, wondering why I don't simply install a Linux disribution on that thing. Well, I like to hurt myself, essentially.
