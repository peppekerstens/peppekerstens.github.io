To access a Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2) instance remotely, you'll need to set up an SSH server within WSL and configure port forwarding on the Windows host. This allows you to connect to your WSL2 instance from another machine on the network or even remotely.

Here's a breakdown of the process:
1. Configure SSH Server within WSL:
Install OpenSSH server:
In your WSL distribution (e.g., Ubuntu), install the OpenSSH server using your distribution's package manager (e.g., sudo apt install openssh-server for Ubuntu). 
Configure SSH server:
Edit the SSH server configuration file (usually /etc/ssh/sshd_config) to enable password or key-based authentication and choose a port (e.g., 2222, as port 22 is typically used by the Windows SSH server). 
Start the SSH server:
Ensure the SSH server starts automatically when you launch WSL and that it's running (e.g., sudo systemctl start ssh and sudo systemctl enable ssh). 
2. Configure Port Forwarding on Windows:
Enable Windows SSH server (if needed):
If you haven't already, enable the Windows OpenSSH server in Windows settings (Optional Features -> View Features -> OpenSSH SSH Client and Server). 
Configure port forwarding:
Use PowerShell (as Administrator) to create a port proxy rule that forwards traffic from a specific port on your Windows host to the WSL2 instance's SSH port. For example: 
Code

    netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 listenport=2222 connectaddress=127.0.0.1 connectport=2222
(This example forwards traffic from port 2222 on all interfaces to port 2222 on the localhost, which is where your WSL instance will be listening). 
Configure Windows Firewall: Ensure that your firewall allows incoming traffic on the chosen port (e.g., 2222).
3. Connecting from a Remote Machine:
Use SSH: From your remote machine, use the SSH client to connect to your Windows host's IP address (or hostname) on the forwarded port. For example: 
Code

    ssh username@your_windows_ip -p 2222
(Replace username with your WSL username and your_windows_ip with the IP address of your Windows machine). 
Using the Windows SSH server as a jump host: You can also configure the Windows SSH server as a jump host to access the WSL2 instance. This involves using the -J flag with SSH, which allows you to connect through the Windows SSH server to reach the WSL2 instance. For example:
Code

    ssh -J your_windows_username@your_windows_ip -p 2222 localhost
(Replace your_windows_username with your Windows username). 
Important Considerations:
Mirrored Networking:
If you are on Windows 11 22H2 or higher, consider using mirrored networking mode in your .wslconfig file for potentially improved performance. 
Security:
For enhanced security, consider using SSH keys instead of passwords for authentication and using a non-standard SSH port. 
WSL Restart:
After making changes to your .wslconfig file or other WSL configurations, you'll need to restart WSL for the changes to take effect (e.g., wsl --shutdown then wsl).
